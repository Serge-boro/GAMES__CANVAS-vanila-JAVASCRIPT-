  In this repository episode I showed you how to make games with JavaScript and HTML canvas from scratch with no libraries. In this cases I used sprite animation, keyboard input and build custom algorithm to control how often request animation method serves frames of animation loop using Data.now(), promise, constructor, 
JavaScript methods. All with vanilla JS.

  The main gold this projects was improving practice JavaScript techniques that are useful for web development in general not just for games. 
  
  Images comes from general Google search, used for demonstration purposes only.

 So don't be shy and be my guest...

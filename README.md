  In this repository episode I showed you how to make games with JavaScript and HTML canvas from scratch with no libraries. In this cases I used sprite animation, keyboard input and build custom algorithm to control how often request animation method serves frames of animation loop using Data.now(), promise, constructor JavaScript methods. All with vanilla JS.

  The main gold this projects was improving practice JavaScript techniques that are useful for web development in general not just for games. 
  
  Images comes from general Google search, used for demonstration purposes only.

 So don't be shy and be my guest...
 
## Notification 
 This notification for people who want to check right writing code, not for who want to take relax. 
Please don't judge this repository too strict in part writting code just because the games was creating a couple years ago. Pretty often you can find varables without camelCase, perhaps you can find 'var', some games was creatind without constructor method using same way to display pictures. I didn't fix it up just because every games includes more than 300 varables similar like I mentioned and I just don't have the heaped huge time to fix all of these.


Nowdays code you cann't find issues similar like I discribed above
